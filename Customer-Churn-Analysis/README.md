## üîç Key Insights

- **Overall Churn Rate:** 26.5%
- **Highest churn** occurs among **Premium customers** (34%)
- **Month-to-Month contracts** significantly increase the risk of churn
- Customers using **Electronic Check** as a payment method are more likely to churn
- **New customers (low tenure)** are at the highest risk
- **Customers subscribed to fewer services** (especially phone-only plans) have higher churn
- **Among Premium customers with Month-to-Month contracts**, those using **non-automatic payment methods** show the **highest churn rate**  
  ‚û§ This suggests that combining flexible contracts with manual payments reduces commitment and increases ease of exit.
- **Services like Online Backup, Tech Support, Streaming TV, and Device Protection** appear to improve retention, acting as "stickiness" factors.

## ‚úÖ Strategic Recommendations

- **Promote Long-Term Contracts**  
  Encourage customers to move away from month-to-month plans by offering discounts, loyalty points, or bundled packages.

- **Target Low-Tier Segments with Value-Added Offers**  
  Offering tailored bundles or perks may improve retention.

- **Upsell Value-Retaining Services**  
  Focus on increasing subscriptions to services such as **Online Backup, Tech Support, Device Protection, and Streaming Services** to improve engagement and customer stickiness.

- **Encourage Stable Payment Methods**  
  Customers using automatic payment methods like **credit cards** or **bank transfers** show lower churn. Promote auto-pay adoption with small incentives like discounts.

- **Increase Cross-Selling of Additional Services**  
  Customers with multiple services tend to stay longer. Use cross-selling strategies to expand service portfolios.

- **Onboard and Engage New Customers Effectively**  
  Since churn is highest among new customers, enhance the onboarding experience, offer proactive support, and guide them through service setup early on.
